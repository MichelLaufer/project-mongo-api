# Mongo API Project

This week's project at the Technigo boot camp was to practice MongoDB by 
using a database to store and retrieve data from and use that data to
produce a RESTful API.

Tech:
<br>MongoDB, Mongoose, Express</br>

I used data on books and created a Mongoose model. 
I created API endpoints for returning the array of books sorted by average rating, 
using query for searching for titles and params for language code, isbn and id number.

Deployed project: https://michel-project-mongo.herokuapp.com/books
